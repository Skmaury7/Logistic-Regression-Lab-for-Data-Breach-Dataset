# Logistic Regression Lab ‚Äì Data Breach Analysis

This repository contains my completed homework assignment for the Logistic Regression Lab in the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course. The lab explores how logistic regression can be applied to real-world data breach incidents to classify whether a breach affects a large number of individuals.

## üìÅ Files Included

- `notebook_(2).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and analysis
- `Logistic Regression Lab_Sami Maury.pdf`: PDF export of the completed notebook with all outputs
- `notebook (1).ipynb`: Earlier version of the notebook (see final version above)

## üìä Objective

To build and evaluate a logistic regression model that predicts whether a data breach is "large" (affecting more than 10,000 individuals) based on:

- Type of breach (e.g., hacking, insider theft, loss of physical device)
- Type of organization affected (e.g., medical, government, business)

## üß† Key Concepts Learned

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Training and testing logistic regression models using scikit-learn
- Interpreting model coefficients and predictions
- Evaluating performance with confusion matrix and classification metrics

## üìå Results Summary

- Medical organizations were the strongest predictor of large breaches
- The model had reasonable accuracy but struggled with class imbalance
- Hacking and government breaches were also linked to larger-scale incidents

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection Questions

See the notebook or PDF for full written responses to:
1. What does logistic regression predict in this context?
2. Which features seem most important?
3. What are the limitations of the model?
4. How can organizations use this information to improve security?
